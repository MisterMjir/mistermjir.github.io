  <h1>Where to listen</h1>
  <p>
    I don't think this site will be that updated, you can find my latest releases on
    <a target="_blank" href="https://mistermjir.bandcamp.com">Bandcamp</a>, and they'll
    eventually reach all your favorite major streaming platforms like 
    <a target="_blank" href="https://open.spotify.com/artist/2Q5N3jiHcxc5RleZ7Od2xd">Spotify</a>.
    I have a <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/@mistermjir">YouTube</a> as well
    that I don't keep up with.

  <h1>Discography</h1>
  <p>A probably non-comprehensive list of the music I've worked on in reverse chronological order.</p>
  <h2>Early electronic</h2>
  <p>
    These are a bunch of singles that were all made as a process of learning FL studio. I'm currently making more. When
    I think I get decently good I'll start making an album/EP, I don't think anyone cares about the difference
    anyways...
  </p>
  <h2>alphabit_soup</h1>
  <p>
    A collection of 26 chiptunes all made with PxTone. PxTone is a free music software created by the guy who made
    the video game Cavestory. The first song was released on June 25, 2021 and last on June 25, 2023. Actually a
    pure coincidence it's on the same day but years apart. My debut album I guess? You can find the full album on
    my Bandcamp or any major music streaming service.
  </p>
  <h2>Assorted chiptunes</h2>
  <p>
    These are some tracks I made before alphabit_soup. Apparently I was using
    <a target="_blank" href="https://soundcloud.com/user-5009033">Soundcloud</a> a long time ago. I also have
    some tracks made for miscellaneous purposes that are on my YouTube.
  </p>
  <h2>Lost era</h2>
  <p>
    I made a bunch of tracks in middle school using Garage Band loops. Sadly I think they are all deleted and lost
    to time. They were the first songs I ever made though, and they were on YouTube at some point.
