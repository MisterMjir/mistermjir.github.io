  <h1>Where to listen</h1>
  <p>
    I don't think this site will be that updated, you can find my latest releases on
    <a target="_blank" href="https://mistermjir.bandcamp.com">Bandcamp</a>, and they'll
    eventually reach all your favorite major streaming platforms like 
    <a target="_blank" href="https://open.spotify.com/artist/2Q5N3jiHcxc5RleZ7Od2xd">Spotify</a>.
    I have a <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/@mistermjir">YouTube</a> as well
    that I don't keep up with.

  <h1>Discography</h1>
  <p>A probably non-comprehensive list of the music I've worked on in reverse chronological order.</p>

      <h2>My Hero's Journey</h2>
      <span>Album 2025</span>

    <div class="album-info">
      <div class="album-info-img"><img src="/assets/images/albums/my_heros_journey.jpg"></div>
      <p>An album about the hero's journey, like what you learned in English class a long time ago once. This is my second album, and my first album featuring electronic music that's not solely chiptune.</p>

      <p>I sampled some bucket drumming one day and turned it into a lofi jazzy track. Personally, I think it's really good so I just released it as a single.</p>

      <p>I got a job and was able to buy FL studio to start experimenting with new sounds! This is a collection of singles I made while messing around and learning FL studio. Not really a main release, but I released it anyways for fun.</p>

        Some old tracks I found that were made on Garage Band on an iPad in 2022. Most are just released as is. Also I guess they are no longer lost lol.

        A collection of 26 chiptunes all made with PxTone. PxTone is a free music software created by the guy who made
        the video game Cavestory. The first song was released on June 25, 2021 and last on June 25, 2023. Actually a
        pure coincidence it's on the same day but years apart. My debut album I guess? You can find the full album on
        my Bandcamp or any major music streaming service.
